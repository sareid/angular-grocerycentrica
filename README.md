#Angular GroceryCentrica

This demo was built for a Tech Talk given at AppCentrica. In a previous talk, someone built a [grocery store list app in React](https://github.com/AppCentrica-Inc/grocerycentrica). This demo shows how to build a similar app in Angular 2.

###Installation

1. You'll need Node.js and npm [installed](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/85484771375/how-to-install-npm), if you don't already. You'll need node v4.x.x or higher and npm 3.x.x or higher.

2. Clone this Repo, and in the local director run `npm start` from the command line to launch the app. You can see it in the browser at `http://localhost:3000/`
